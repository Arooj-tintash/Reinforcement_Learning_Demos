Trying three different ways to implement Atari games:
--> using numpy q-learning
--> using tensorflow Q-learning
--> using keras DQN

Implementing Q-learning using numpy and tensorflow by following Karpathy blog post: http://karpathy.github.io/2016/05/31/rl/
and implementing it's simpler version by following a blog post: https://medium.com/@dhruvp/how-to-write-a-neural-network-to-play-pong-from-scratch-956b57d4f6e0 and 
github link: https://github.com/dhruvp/atari-pong/blob/master/me_pong.py for different atari games.

Implementing DQN by following github link to another atari game: https://github.com/rlcode/reinforcement-learning/blob/master/3-atari/1-breakout/breakout_dqn.py
